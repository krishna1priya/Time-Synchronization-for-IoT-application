# Time-Synchronization-for-IoT-application

This project implements a home automation system model that leverages remote sensor data to make intelligent decisions tailored to the household environment. The system is built upon a robust infrastructure featuring two Raspberry Pi B3 (RPi) boards, with one serving as the server and the other as the client. 

The server RPi is augmented with ultrasonic and temperature sensors. The temperature sensor is employed for precise ambient temperature measurement, while the ultrasonic sensor serves as a motion detector for occupancy detection when the premises are expected to be unoccupied. These sensors continuously collect data from their surroundings and transmit it to the Raspberry Pi, which subsequently forwards it to the cloud-based database, using ThingsSpeak as the chosen cloud platform. The collected data is meticulously stored in the cloud database. Data is regularly updated every second, thus ensuring real-time synchronization with the cloud. The cloud platform acts as a secure repository for the acquired sensor data.

The second RPi, designated as the client, is designed to subscribe to specific data fields within the cloud database. At this juncture, multiple communication protocols are seamlessly integrated to interact with the cloud infrastructure for data retrieval. Two pivotal protocols utilized in this project are MQTT and CoAP. The client RPi conveniently displays the retrieved data on a terminal interface, which can be extended to various output mediums, such as computer screens, LCD or TFT displays. This flexible display interface enables users to conveniently monitor the sensor data and make informed decisions.

The acquired data from the cloud database is amenable to further analysis and processing. For instance, the system can be programmed to send alerts to homeowners when the ambient temperature surpasses predefined thresholds, like 80 degrees Celsius. The cloud platform, bolstered by MATLAB integration, offers the capability to perform complex data processing tasks, enabling advanced automation and decision-making.

Additionally, the cloud platform offers the visualization of sensor data through graph representations, which enhances data insights and can assist in identifying patterns and trends in the environment. This project, by amalgamating advanced sensor technology, cloud-based data storage, and flexible data retrieval and processing protocols, forms a powerful home automation system for modern, smart living.
